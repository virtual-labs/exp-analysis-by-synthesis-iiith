### Procedure

- Step1: Choose any of the pre-recorded speech signals from the 'Select an audio file' dropdown menu.

- Step2: Play the audio file and observe the waves.

- Step3: Click on the 'Generate Spectrum' button, 'LP order', 'Graphy Type' dropdown options, Excitation, Log Energy and Pitch Countour will be displayed.

- Step4: Study the characteristics of generated 'LP residual' signal. This residual is generated using a 'LP order' of 11 and will be used to synthesize the speech signal in further stages of experiment.

- Step5: Observe the excitation signal that would be used to synthesize the speech signal. Also choose the order of LP coefficients to be used to synthesize the speech.

- Step6: Study the synthesized speech signal according to the parameters chosen. Study the characteristics of the re synthesised speech by using different excitation types, namely, 'LP Residual' and 'Impulse' excitation excitation.

- Step7: Study the effect of using the vocal tract system derived using different LP orders for resynthesis. Zoom into the waveform to study different regions of the synthesized waveform.

- Step8: Repeat the experiment for sentences recorded with your own voice.
